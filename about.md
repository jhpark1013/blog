Hi, my name is Jaehee. Welcome to my blog!

I am a software engineer who is interested in embedded systems and all kinds of state-of-the-art imaging devices.

In this blog I will document my experience developing embedded linux applications on fpgas.

I also plan to share some insights into computer vision algorithms I use for health-monitoring such as photoplethysmography and eye-tracking, and discuss how we can use them to improve our lives.

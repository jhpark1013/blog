Hi, my name is Jaehee Park (pronounced "Jay-hee"). Welcome to my blog!

I am a software engineer who is interested in embedded systems and all kinds of state-of-the-art imaging devices.

In this blog, I will document my experience learning about embedded applications, the Linux kernel, networking concepts, programming, debugging, and many more!

I have done some [work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MfOeFRAAAAAJ&hl=en) previously on optics and computer vision algorithms in past years.

In my spare time, I'm learning Chinese and trying out new recipes. I love to bike and hike. I also enjoy tinkering with FPGAs -- I'll hopefully be writing more about this, too!  

<!-- also plan to share some insights into computer vision algorithms I use for health-monitoring such as photoplethysmography and eye-tracking, and discuss how we can use them to improve our lives. -->
